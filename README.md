### Leehan's Instagram Application 

#### 1. Create new project.
* In this process, you need to **be careful** with the choice of Interface **'Storyboard'**.
if you are not selected, then 'AppDelegate', 'SceneDelegate', 'ViewController' will not be created.

#### 2. Create some folders to start organizing project.
* Create New groups below 
* Controllers / Views / Models(data layer) / Resources (hold everything that doesn't fit into these other three folders) 

** As your projects get larger especially with big projects if you don't organize early on you end up in quite a bind **

#### 3. Organization
* move 'AppDelegate', 'SceneDelegate' to Resources folder.
* move 'ViewController' to Controllers folder. 
* move 'Main', 'Assets', 'LaunchScreen' to Views folder.
* create new group 'Storyboards' below the Views folder, including 'Main', 'LaunchScreen'.

#### 4. Rename this controller that was given to us.
* It's called 'ViewController' very vague and generic. So we're going to update all of these names.
